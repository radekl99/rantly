Live demo: https://rantly-d326f.firebaseapp.com/
### Description
Rantly is Twitter like React app for complaining about everything. In this practice project I wanted to implent social media apps features such us: 
- Posting
- Liking posts
- Commenting
- Following users
- Deleting posts and comments
- Updating profile
### For this project I used
- React(Hooks, Context, Redux, Router)
- Firebase(Auth, Realtime Database, Storage, Hosting)
- CSS Modules
- Font Awesome
### If I had more time...
I would improve  structure and way of storing data in database to limit data that user have to download from there. I would also implement sorting posts system and admin account to manage users and posts.
